Do you have enough luck and strategy to get all your tokens home, first? Prove it!

Play against the game developers of beloved jam titles like The lost walkman, Scrap Racer, The nightshift,  Clockwork or Bahama Banana üå¥.

## The game

Ur is a 4.5k yr old game that... hey, why did you fall asleep? Hello? WAKE UP!

Ok, long story short. Bring your seven tokens to the goal first by rolling the four ancient dice. Each die can roll zero or one, where the white tip indicates one. All dice numbers get summed up after a roll.

_"But, umm, what if there is no white tip at all? Did I just rolled a zero?"_

Yes, you did! Bad for you, you're turn is wasted...

Now you can move a token on the board with the rolled number. But watch out! Your enemy can kick you out on the red fields. Well, you can do that with your enemy, too.

See, the fields with the die symbol? If you land on them, you can re-roll + the enemy can't kick you out. YES, double trouble!

Below you see a beautiful hand-writen mspaint diagram about your way home.
